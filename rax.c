     * themselves.
     *
     * In order to show a real case imagine our node to also point to
     * another compressed node, that finally points at the node without
     * children, representing 'O':
     *
     *     "ANNIBALE" -> "SCO" -> []
     *
     * When inserting we may face the following cases. Note that all the cases

     * 1) Inserting "ANNIENTARE"

     *     "ANNI" -> |-|
     *               |E| -> (... continue algo ...) "NTARE" -> []
     *
     * 2) Inserting "ANNIBALI"
     *
     *                  |E| -> "SCO" -> []
     *     "ANNIBAL" -> |-|
     *                  |I| -> (... continue algo ...) []
     *
     * 3) Inserting "AGO" (Like case 1, but set iscompr = 0 into original node)
     *
     *            |N| -> "NIBALE" -> "SCO" -> []
     *     |A| -> |-|
     *            |G| -> (... continue algo ...) |O| -> []
     *
     * 4) Inserting "CIAO"
     *
     *     |A| -> "NNIBALE" -> "SCO" -> []
     *     |-|
     *     |C| -> (... continue algo ...) "IAO" -> []
     *
     * 5) Inserting "ANNI"
     *
     *     "ANNI" -> "BALE" -> "SCO" -> []
     *
     * The final algorithm for insertion covering all the above cases is as
     * follows.
     *
     * ============================= ALGO 1 =============================
     *
     * For the above cases 1 to 4, that is, all cases where we stopped in
     * the middle of a compressed node for a character mismatch, do:
     *
     * Let $SPLITPOS be the zero-based index at which, in the
     * compressed node array of characters, we found the mismatching
     * character. For example if the node contains "ANNIBALE" and we add
     * "ANNIENTARE" the $SPLITPOS is 4, that is, the index at which the
     * mismatching character is found.
     *
     * 1. Save the current compressed node $NEXT pointer (the pointer to the
     *    child element, that is always present in compressed nodes).
     *
     * 2. Create "split node" having as child the non common letter
     *    at the compressed node. The other non common letter (at the key)
     *    will be added later as we continue the normal insertion algorithm
     *    at step "6".
     *
     * 3a. IF $SPLITPOS == 0:
     *     Replace the old node with the split node, by copying the auxiliary
     *     data if any. Fix parent's reference. Free old node eventually
     *     (we still need its data for the next steps of the algorithm).
     *
     * 3b. IF $SPLITPOS != 0:
     *     Trim the compressed node (reallocating it as well) in order to
     *     contain $splitpos characters. Change chilid pointer in order to link
     *     to the split node. If new compressed node len is just 1, set
     *     iscompr to 0 (layout is the same). Fix parent's reference.
     *
     * 4a. IF the postfix len (the length of the remaining string of the
     *     original compressed node after the split character) is non zero,
     *     create a "postfix node". If the postfix node has just one character
     *     set iscompr to 0, otherwise iscompr to 1. Set the postfix node
     *     child pointer to $NEXT.
     *
     * 4b. IF the postfix len is zero, just use $NEXT as postfix pointer.
     *
     * 5. Set child[0] of split node to postfix node.
     *
     * 6. Set the split node as the current node, set current index at child[1]
     *    and continue insertion algorithm as usually.
     *
     * ============================= ALGO 2 =============================
     *
     * For case 5, that is, if we stopped in the middle of a compressed
     * node but no mismatch was found, do:
     *
     * Let $SPLITPOS be the zero-based index at which, in the
     * compressed node array of characters, we stopped iterating because
     * there were no more keys character to match. So in the example of
     * the node "ANNIBALE", addig the string "ANNI", the $SPLITPOS is 4.
     *
     * 1. Save the current compressed node $NEXT pointer (the pointer to the
     *    child element, that is always present in compressed nodes).
     *
     * 2. Create a "postfix node" containing all the characters from $SPLITPOS
     *    to the end. Use $NEXT as the postfix node child pointer.
     *    If the postfix node length is 1, set iscompr to 0.
     *    Set the node as a key with the associated value of the new
     *    inserted key.
     *
     * 3. Trim the current node to contain the first $SPLITPOS characters.
     *    As usually if the new node length is just 1, set iscompr to 0.
     *    Take the iskey / associated value as it was in the orignal node.
     *    Fix the parent's reference.
